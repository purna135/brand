# PyMC Devs Branding

This section contains PyMC Dev's branding standards and guidelines.
Note:  
- `AI` is the filename extension used by Adobe Illustrator
- `EPS` is Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format ([format was used previously](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-ai-and-eps-in-adobe-illustrator/#ixzz7U3iIOKeC.))
- `SVG` Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are an XML-based markup language for describing two-dimensional based vector graphics. They can be created and edited with any text editor or with drawing software.
- `PNG` is a higher-quality compression format; size of file is generally larger
- `JPG` images are generally of lower quality, but are faster to load
- `ICO` file format refers to an image file format that contains small size computer icon images
